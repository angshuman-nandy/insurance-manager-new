## ** How to run the test suite **


 I have added some seeds to the project which might help in the evaluation process. I have added one admin account, one customer account, 2 companies and 2 insurance plans . Some parts of the project is visible to admins only, and any user Signing Up is made a customer by default. Only an admin may promote another user to admin, therefore it will be convenient to use the default admin account that I created with seeds.

admin account:
          login: admin@gmail.com
   password: password

customer account:
          login:user@gmail.com
   password: password
